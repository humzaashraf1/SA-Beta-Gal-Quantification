# SA-Beta-Gal-Quantification
A novel method for quantifying and thresholding senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase staining 

The method calls the 5th percentile of the red pixel distribution within each segmented cytoplasm the beta-galactosidase signal.

The "example_outputs" folder in the repo contains input and output tiff files of fluorescence + beta-galactosidase staining overlaid as a M x N x Z stack.
'1_6_1_bgalsignal' is a visual representation of the output, where the red-blue colormap represents high to low signal intensity.
